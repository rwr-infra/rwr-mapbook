# About

This is a handbook for the Running With Rifles map editor: **what every panel does, which
models you can place, which key does what, and how to fill in the configuration files**.
It was written by people who make maps, not by the developers.

## How the URLs are laid out

Version first, language second — so the same page has its own address in every version
and every language:

```mermaid
graph TD
  A["/ · current · Simplified"] --> B["/en/ · current · English"]
  A --> C["/zh-hant/ · current · Traditional"]
  A --> D["/egg/ · the egg · Simplified"]
  D --> E["/egg/en/"]
  D --> F["/egg/zh-hant/"]
```

## What has not been verified

Not every line has been tried. Where that is the case, the page says so — read with care:

| Marker | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| **Untested** | the whole page has not been checked item by item |
| **Incomplete** | written only halfway, or mentioned in a single sentence |
| not tried / no idea what this is | the author did not verify that row either — **fill it in as shown, but do not treat it as a conclusion** |

The "it is said that…" passages are kept as written too.
**This handbook does not second-guess the source.**

!!! quote "What is written straight, and what you have to click open"
    These notes are written for people who build maps: conclusions are written
    straight, with the wording left alone — "crashes on load", "no collision box",
    "whatever you do, do not file every material error under template meshes" all
    stay exactly as written. Polished into formal prose, a reader could no longer
    tell how certain the author was.

    Anything unverified still carries its marker: "untested", "not tried". The
    meaning has not changed — it means nobody has tried it yet, which is not the
    same as "it works" or "it does not".

    The author's own asides and complaints are a separate case: they affect no
    conclusion, but left in the body they make the whole page read like something
    other than a manual, so they go into **click-to-open** blocks. Clicking one still
    shows the original wording, so a reader can still tell how certain the author was.
